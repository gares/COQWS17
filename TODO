lesson1:
- a bit too long, cut/compress the first 4 slides
- find a way to explain "move=> /foo" v.s. "apply/foo".

lesson2:
- recap example, not very useful
- explain nth
- make specialize explicit in a dedicated slide /(_ x)
- messy slide about have pulls too many things in

lesson3:
- simplify ex about parking, maybe a simpler pigeonhole would do

lesson4:
- explicit example with "rewrite unlock" showing that the computational
  content is there (but locked)
